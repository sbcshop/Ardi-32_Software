### Example Codes
   Save whatever example code file you want to try as main.py in pico w as shown in above [step 3](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiPi_Software/tree/main#3-how-to-move-your-script-on-pico-w-of-ardipi), also add related lib files with default name.
   In [example](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiFi_Software/tree/main/examples) folder you will find demo example script code to test onboard components of ArdiPi like 
   - [Buzzer](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiFi_Software/blob/main/examples/BuzzerDemo.py), 
   - [SD card](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiFi_Software/blob/main/examples/sdcardDemo.py),
   
   Also, sample codes are available for ArdiPi shields
   - [Relay](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiFi_Software/blob/main/examples/relay_shield_demo.py) : code test switching of relays in sequence 
   - [RFID](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiFi_Software/blob/main/examples/RFID_shield_demo.py) : code to test RFID module scan and switching of Relay
   - [Display](https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiFi_Software/blob/main/examples/display_shield_Demo.py) : testing of display and programmable buttons
   - [UHF]() : testing onboard UHF module , buzzer and display unit of shield 
   
   Using this sample code as a guide, you can modify, build, and share codes!!
